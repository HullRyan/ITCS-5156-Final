# Presentation and Paper Guidelines

## Summary

This document describes the process of creating a presentation and paper about my survey andf implementation of GLocal-K, a machine learning recommender system.

## GLocal-K Implementation

- [ ] Implement GLocal-K algorithm in Python, using the following libraries:
  - [ ] Numpy
  - [ ] Pandas
  - [ ] Scikit-learn
  - [ ] Matplotlib
  - [ ] Seaborn
  - [ ] Scipy
  - [ ] Jupyter Notebook
- [ ] Comment code and explain the implementation to make my own understanding of the algorithm clear
- [ ] Explain the implementation using Scikit-learn's API vs the original paper's implementation using Tensorflow
- [ ] Explain the implementation using the original paper's implementation using Tensorflow and if there are any differences


## Presentation Outline

PDF submission of presentation slides, and video presentation of the slides.

- [ ] Introduction
- [ ] Problem Statement
- [ ] Background
- [ ] Related approaches and challenges
- [ ] GLocal-K Algorithm and Implementation
- [ ] Results and observations
- [ ] Conclusion, Future Work, and References
- [ ] Video Presentation

### Notes for Presentation

- Should include graphs and charts, and should be visually appealing

Examples of graph ideas:
  
- GLocal-K overview graph
- Explanation of kernel functions
- Different recommendation systems algorithms

## Paper Outline

Must be written as a research survey paper.
